Open main1.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do? 
-It should just display the text and give a chance for the user to type something.

Now right click on the main1.py window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened. 
-It asked about its favorite color and allowed me to type a response.

What do you think the program did with what you typed?
-absolutely nothing, it didn't have a variable to store it under

Open main2.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main1.py. 
-The input portion has "color=" in front of it, and there is a new line that will display the response of the user.

What do you think the color = input() will do? 
It will store the input as a variable

Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?
-Yes, exactly.

Open main3.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main2.py. 
-Now there is a greeting, and a line of code that creates an if/then scenario that will display one of two messages.

What is happening on lines 11–14? 
-an if/then scenario (forgive me if the terminology is wrong, I just know the jist of what is going on)
which makes it to where the user inputting "Red" will display one thing, but anything else will make it display the second option

Why are lines 12 and 14 indented? 
-Because they are a commands that only get ran if they meet the parameters set in the above lines of code 

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red? 
-It will display the "Sorry try again" line.

What does this tell you about "color"?
-It saves exactly what you type, and if it does not match the 'if' line perfectly, it triggers the 'else' option.

Open main4.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main3.py. 
-Now there is an 'or' parameter that allows the user to type "red" and get the "correct" response.

What problem is this trying to solve? 
-variations in capitalization being used in the response.

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?
-It displays the 'sorry' line.

Open main5.py. What do you expect line 11 to do? 
-It will set any letter saved in the color response to the lowercase version, eliminating the variations in capitalization

What problem is it trying to solve? 
-Captalization variations

Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “  RED  “ or “ red”)?
-It runs the 'sorry' text

Open main6.py. How is line 11 different than main5.py? 
-it has .strip after the color.lower() variable

What would you guess .strip() is doing? 
-removing spaces

Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?
-Probably typos.

Open main7.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main6.py? 
-It will give a new response if the user types pink

What is the purpose of line 11? 
-It changes the variable saved to a stripped, all lowercase version, so capitalization variations of the word pink won't matter either.

Run the program and answer the question.
-Okay.

Open main8.py. What is the purpose of line 11? 
-It will make the input question keep displaying until the user types 'red'

Why are lines 12–19 indented? 
-Because the code will only be run while the parameters for the "while" line are met

Run the program. What would happen if line 12 were moved before line 11 (and no longer indented)? 
-It would ask the question once, but if the answer wasn't 'red,' it would just constantly display the 'sorry' message

Make that change and run the program again. To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c.
-Yup.

Open main9.py. What is happening on line 12? 
-it has the 'while' scenario set up.

What is the purpose of “count”? 
-It creates a number equal to the amount of times the user types an answer.

What is happening on line 22? 
-It displays a message that includes the number of times the user typed an answer to the question, aka the count variable.

Run the program.
-Ran it.
