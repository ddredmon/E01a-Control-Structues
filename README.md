# E01a-Control-Structues
 
 Hello, welcome to the descriptive page of this project. The purpose of this collection of code is to teach our game tech class how to read and understand codes, and also code a bit ourselves. The many main.py files here have example codes that do different things, with the questions.txt file giving questions on each of them. Its pretty simple and straightforward, but here ya go. Oh, and I did the extra credit bit, so main10.py has a bunch of comments.
